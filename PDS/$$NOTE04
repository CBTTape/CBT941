Hello Sam,

Could you please consider the attached file? There are few error
fixes for the already published code, drastically updated HTML
documentation, which is delivered in UNICODE UTF-8 encoding now
to avoid reported problem caused by the different code pages used
for EBCDIC-ASII transfer. HTML members may be transferred to the
workstation (PC) as binary files now.

BTW. This binary transfer is not 100% correct, because CRLF lost
in this case, but transferred HTML pages represented properly,
regardless of losted CRLF. To get an original HTML files with
CRLF they should be transferred in text mode after the following
SITE directive:

QUOTE SITE ENCODING=MBCS DBSUB MBDATA=(UTF-8,UTF-8) MBSENDSEOL=CRLF

However, as I wrote before, binary transfer would be strong
enough to get a correct data representation.

Member $NOTE00 updated accordingly. All code re-tested under z/OS 2.4.

I've also added the following tools:

LZ       -  Full screen list and browse of ZIP archives under ISPF.

LM       -  Copy, move, delete, rename, update statistic of
            PDS/PDSE members using ISPF LM service.

RXGIM    -  REXX interface to SMP/E (GIMAPI) written in PL/I.
            Both source and load provided. An alternative of
            CBTTAPE FILE 778 by Daniel Gaeta, but RXGIM returns
            structured data.

SCT      -  Cloning tool. Copies runtime code to the desired
            environment and change code as specified to enable it
            to be executed in that environment.

ISPCS    -  Start ISPF Client/Server session with single click on
            Windows icon without use 3270 session at all.

Thank you in advance,
Gregory
