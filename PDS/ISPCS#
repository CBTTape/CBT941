ISPF Client/Server (ISPF C/S) session initiation with one click

Function:
    Initiate ISPF C/S session with single click on Windows icon, without
    entering any data and without any 3270 emulator at all

Description
    Standard method to start ISPF C/S session as described in manuals:
    - Open terminal session using any 3270 terminal emulator (IBM Personal
      Communication, Rocket Bluezone, wc3270, OnNet Host Suite, Cygwin c3270
      x3270, qws3270 etc.).
    - Under ISPF call "Options" panel (=0). "General Setting" panel appears.
    - Pull "Workstation" menu and enter option 1, "Initiate Workstation
      Connection" window appears
    - Fill required data (most important here is workstation IP address),
      then press "enter" key. ISPF C/S session initiated.

Disadvantages
    Terminal session used to initiate ISPF C/S remains active and cannot be
    closed, otherwise ISPF C/S session fails. As a result of that userid used
    for TSO logon is busy and you cannot open another 3270 session using the
    same userid.
    Another problem is workstation IP address, which may be changed (it is
    almost always changed when you connected to z/OS host via VPN).

Proposed method
    Tune delivered files and initiate ISPF C/S session with single click on
    Windows icon, without entering any data and without any 3270 emulator at
    all.
    Idea is based on the z/OS FTP JES2 interface - ability to submit jobs via
    ftp session.

Installation procedure
    - Copy ISPCSBAT to your workstation as ISPCS.bat, and ISPCSJCL as ISPCS.jcl.
      Both ISPCSBAT and ISPCSJCL are encoded in EBCDIC, so they should be
      transfterred in text (ascii) mode. ISPCS.bat and ISPCS.jcl should be in
      the same Windows directory, probably the best place for both is WSA
      installation directory.
    - Copy WSIP to any library.
    - Modify ISPCS.bat and ISPCS.jcl before use to reflect your environment:
      ISPCS.bat:
      Change userid, password and host (z/OS) name as required. If you want to
      start WSA (Workstartion Agent) automatically, uncomment an appropriate
      start command.
      ISPCS.jcl:
      Update data sets allocation as required for your installation and your
      personal need. Please use widely known Doug Nadel's BATCHPDF to get your
      data set allocation, or use IBM supplied TSO/ISPF command ISRDDN. Also
      update CODEPAGE and CHARSET on ISPSTART command accordingly to your
      local language environment (for example, countries using cyrillic rather
      than latin may prefer CODEPAGE(1025) CHARSET(1150) to use national
      character set).
    - Modify ISPCS.jcl to reflect WSIP location (SYSPROC DD).
