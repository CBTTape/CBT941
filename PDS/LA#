Function:
        Delete, rename, copy, move, update statistic of PDS/PDSE members
        using ISPF LM service.

Syntax:
       LM { Delete library(member) }
          { Rename library(member) NEWname(member) }
          { Stat   library(member) ÝUser(id)¨ ÝCReated(date)¨
                   ÝUPdated(date time)¨ }
          { Copy   library(member) libraryÝ(member)¨ }
          { Move   library(member) libraryÝ(member)¨ }

Usage:
        Unlike TSO and IDCAMS commands, ISPF LM service can access members
        even if library allocated to someone else. This procedure useful
        for batch, because ISPF 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 are preferred.
