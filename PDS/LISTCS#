Function:
 	This standalone job is used to objective comparison of the load or
        program libraries.

Syntax:
        SUBMIT LISTCS

Usage:
  	This job ran LISTIDR function of AMBLIST utility against any member
        of the specified load or program library, post-process LISTIDR output
        using DFSORT to get a list of members and csects in a unified form:
        MEMBER SLEEP   CSECT SLEEP     PRODUCED BY 569623400 01.04 ON 2013-02-25
        MEMBER SLEEP   CSECT PARSLIST  PRODUCED BY 569623400 01.04 ON 2013-02-25
        MEMBER ENCODE  CSECT ENCODE    PRODUCED BY 569623400 01.05 ON 2007-09-10
        MEMBER TASID   CSECT TASIDPNL  PRODUCED BY 569623400 01.04 ON 2003-11-20
        MEMBER TASID   CSECT TASIDPNL  PRODUCED BY PL/X-390  02.01 ON 2003-11-20

        This list would be the same for both load and program library. Using
        this list we can objectively compare load/program libraries to identify
        changed modules. List sorted by date, member name, csect name, produced
        component.

        So, this comparision method do not claim false differences when
        - load modules just copied from one library to another one (including
          PDS to PDSE and PDSE to PDS copying)
        - load modules rebuilt from the same OBJ/NCAL modules
        - load modules rebuilt as a result of SMP/E APPLY from the same SYSMOD

        Specify data set name to process on the line 3 of the job.
