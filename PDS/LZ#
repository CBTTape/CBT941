Syntax:
        LZ Ýarchive¨

        - a quoted full-qualified library and member name like 'IBMUSER.ZIPS(A)'
        - absolute path, like /u/ibmuser/z.zip

Usage:
        LZ may be used as a primary command as well as a line command on
        the data set list (panel ISRUDSL0), member list (panel ISRUDSM)
        and file list (panel ISRUUDL0).

Supported line commands:
        B - browse archive file
        V - view archive file
        E - invoke edit for archive file (archive not changed after exit!)

Supported primary commands:
        FIND - search archive list for a specified target case insensitively
        SORT - sort archive file list on name, size or date

Required:
        UNZIP 5.52 should be available. Load library LZ.LOADLIB included,
        delivered as member LZLOAD. If you do not have UNZIP 5.52 available,
        please restore delivered library to userid.LZ.LOADLIB:
        RECEIVE INDATASET(FILE941(LZLOAD))
        LZ issues LIBDEF ISPLLIB against userid.LZ.LOADLIB. If you have
        UNZIP available on the standard search libraries, please assign
        variable ispllib to blank.
