Function:
 	Reallocate space for existing data set, existing data may be kept. Also
        can convert PDS to PDSE and vice versa, update record format, record
        length, block size, expiration date.

Syntax:
        RESIZE dsname

Usage:
  	RESIZE may be used as a command on ISPF =6 or on COMMAND prompt, but most

You can type over values highlighted and press enter key. A new data set with
unique name would be allocated, then data would be copied from old data set to
the new unless "Keep data" option is "N". When data sucessfully copied and
original data set would be deleted and new allocated one renamed to an original
name.

An original record format (RECFM) as well as record length (LRECL) and block
size (BLKSIZE) may be changed. However, be careful: RESIZE does NOT prevent data
truncation, so you should understand what you do. For example, if you change
RECFM=V,LRECL=255 to RECFM=F,LRECL=80 data truncation may occurs if there are
records longer than 80.

Data set reallocation could be started immediately or performed via generated
job (if option "Submit job" set to "Y"). The last choice may be useful for a
huge data sets or libraries, where copy process may take several minutes.
Volume serial and device type provided for antique z/OS predecessors.

In general, resize is a handy equivalent of the following standard ISPF
functions (4-in-1):

    ISPF 3.2;A allocate new data set with sugessted attributes;
    ISPF 3.3;C copy data from existing data set to new one;
    ISPF 3.2;D delete existing (old) data set;
    ISPF 3.3;R rename new created data set to old name;

RESIZE may be especially useful to resolve E37, D37 system abend - an existing
data set may be easily reallocated to provide free space.

Notes:

    - Do not use "Keep data" option against just allocated sequential data set.
    Attempt to copy data from such data set would fail with "No record found"
    or "wrong length record" condition.
    - Do not use "resize" against data set in use, for instance, allocated by
    your TSO LOGON procedure.
